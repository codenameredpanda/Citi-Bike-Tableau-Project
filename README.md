# Citi-Bike-Tableau-Project

downloaded files from citi bike website. Chose to do two winter and two summer months, one from 2023 and one from 2024. this is to examine winter vs summer and longitudinal usage. Uploaded all the data to a file and created a union by dragging each table to just under the first table until an orange union box appears.
